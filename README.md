The **Node HTTP Adapter** enables your Stone.js application to run in any Node.js HTTP environment. It provides a low-level bridge between raw Node HTTP events and the internal event system of Stone.js, fully aligned with the Continuum Architecture.

---

## Introduction

In Stone.js, **adapters** are the translation layer between the outside world and your internal logic. The Node HTTP Adapter handles incoming HTTP requests from Node’s built-in `http` module, transforming them into standardized `IncomingEvent` objects, and turning your system’s `OutgoingResponse` back into proper HTTP responses.

This adapter allows your Stone.js app to behave like a traditional web server, without requiring Express or any framework overhead, while still benefiting from Stone.js’s unified event model, clean lifecycle, and platform independence.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @stone-js/node-http-adapter
```

> This package is **pure ESM**. Make sure your project uses ESM (`"type": "module"` in `package.json`) or configure your tooling accordingly.

## Usage

You can integrate the adapter either declaratively with a decorator or imperatively using the `nodeHttpAdapterBlueprint`.

### Declarative API

```ts
import { NodeHttp } from '@stone-js/node-http-adapter'
import { StoneApp, IncomingEvent, IEventHandler } from '@stone-js/core'

@StoneApp()
@NodeHttp({ url: 'http://localhost:8081' })
export class Application implements IEventHandler<IncomingEvent> {
  handle(event: IncomingEvent) {
    const name = event.get<string>('name', 'World')
    return { message: `Hello ${name}` }
  }
}
```

### Imperative API

```ts
import { defineStoneApp, IncomingEvent, defineConfig, IBlueprint } from '@stone-js/core'
import { nodeHttpAdapterBlueprint, NODE_HTTP_PLATFORM } from '@stone-js/node-http-adapter'

const handler = (event: IncomingEvent) => {
  const name = event.get<string>('name', 'World')
  return { message: `Hi ${name}` }
}

export const App = defineStoneApp(handler, {}, [nodeHttpAdapterBlueprint])

export const AppConfig = defineConfig({
  afterConfigure(blueprint: IBlueprint) {
    if (blueprint.is('stone.adapter.platform', NODE_HTTP_PLATFORM)) {
      blueprint.set('stone.adapter.url', 'http://localhost:8081')
    }
  }
})
```

## What It Enables

* **Universal HTTP Support**
  Run your Stone.js app on any Node.js HTTP server. No Express or external framework needed.

* **Full Continuum Integration**
  HTTP becomes a native dimension of your system: requests and responses are transformed into `IncomingEvent` and `OutgoingResponse`, respecting the Continuum model.

* **Server-Level Middleware**
  Add `serverMiddleware[]` to intercept raw HTTP traffic before Stone.js handles it. Works with most connect-style middlewares.

* **Lifecycle and Hook Support**
  Includes support for `onStart`, `onStop`, error hooks, and adapter middleware pipelines.

* **Rich Event Context**
  Access IP, cookies, headers, body, uploaded files, and more in a normalized and typed format.

* **Streaming & File Uploads**
  Direct access to Node’s `IncomingMessage` and `ServerResponse` for advanced use cases like streaming or file handling.

* **First-Class TypeScript Support**
  Strong typings for all configuration, events, and response types.

* **Built-in Error Handling**
  Customize how errors are caught and transformed into HTTP responses.

## Configuration Options

| Option               | Type                                      | Description                                                     |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `url`                | `string`                                  | Base URL of the server. Example: `http://localhost:3000`        |
| `isSsl`              | `boolean`                                 | Whether to use HTTPS                                            |
| `server`             | `NodeServerOptions`                       | Native Node server configuration                                |
| `printUrls`          | `boolean`                                 | Log URL(s) to console on server start                           |
| `serverMiddleware[]` | `Array<(req, res, next) => void>`         | Platform-level connect-like middleware before Stone.js kicks in |
| `alias`              | `string`                                  | Optional name for referencing the adapter                       |
| `default`            | `boolean`                                 | Set as default adapter for the app                              |
| `current`            | `boolean`                                 | Mark this as the active adapter during runtime                  |
| `middleware[]`       | `AdapterMixedPipeType[]`                  | Middleware for request/response within the Stone.js lifecycle   |
| `errorHandlers`      | `Record<string, MetaAdapterErrorHandler>` | Fine-grained adapter-level error handling                       |

## Adapter Context Shape

When middleware or integration hooks execute, they receive the following context object:

```ts
interface NodeHttpAdapterContext {
  rawEvent: IncomingMessage;
  rawResponse?: ServerResponse;
  executionContext: NodeHttpServer;
  incomingEvent?: IncomingHttpEvent;
  outgoingResponse?: OutgoingHttpResponse;
  incomingEventBuilder: IAdapterEventBuilder<IncomingHttpEventOptions, IncomingHttpEvent>;
  rawResponseBuilder: IAdapterEventBuilder<RawHttpResponseOptions, IRawResponseWrapper<ServerResponse>>;
}
```

These values expose the full HTTP lifecycle and provide access to Stone.js event builders.

### Incoming HTTP Event Options

```ts
interface IncomingHttpEventOptions {
  url: URL;
  ip: string;
  ips?: string[];
  protocol?: string;
  method?: HttpMethods;
  queryString?: string;
  cookies?: CookieCollection;
  body?: Record<string, unknown>;
  files?: Record<string, UploadedFile[]>;
  headers?: Record<string, string> | Headers;
}
```

### Raw HTTP Response Options

```ts
interface RawHttpResponseOptions {
  body: unknown;
  charset?: string;
  statusCode: number;
  statusMessage: string;
  headers: Map<string, string> | Headers;
  streamFile?: () => void | Promise<void>;
}
```

This context flows through all adapter middleware and hooks.

## Summary
